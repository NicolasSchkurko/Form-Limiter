# Privacy Policy for Form Limiter
**Last Updated:** September 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Form Limiter ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with the Form Limiter Google Forms add-on (the "Service"). Our commitment is to protect your privacy and handle any data with transparency.

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect
We believe in minimal data collection. The Service **does not** collect, store, or transmit any personal identifying information about you or your form respondents. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Names, email addresses, or other personal details.
- The actual content of your form responses.
- Any data you or your users enter into the form.

### 2. Information We Access (But Do Not Store)
To function, the Service requires access to certain metadata about your Google Form. This access is granted by you when you authorize the add-on. The Service accesses the following:
- **Form Responses:** The Service counts the total number of responses to determine if the limit has been reached. It only accesses the count, not the content of the responses themselves.
- **Form Properties:** The Service needs to read and modify the form's settings, such as the confirmation message, the closed-form message, and whether the form is accepting responses.

### 3. Information We Store
The Service stores only the configuration settings you provide directly within the add-on's interface. This data is stored using Google's built-in `PropertiesService`, which associates the data with the script project bound to your form. This data includes:
- The maximum number of responses you set (the "limit").

This information is stored solely for the functioning of the add-on and is not shared with any third parties.

### 4. Data Usage
The information accessed is used exclusively to:
- Check the current number of responses against the limit you set.
- Automatically close the form when the limit is reached.
- Modify the form's confirmation and closed-form messages as configured by you.
- Create a trigger that runs the check on each new form submission.

### 5. Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties. All data and metadata accessed by the Service remain within your Google Account and are processed by Google's infrastructure as part of the Google Apps Script execution.

### 6. Security
We rely on the security measures provided by Google Workspace to protect your information. The add-on operates entirely within the secure environment of Google Apps Script.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
